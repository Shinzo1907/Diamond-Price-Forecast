# Diamond Price Prediction

This repository, named `Diamond-Price-Forecast`, contains a project for predicting diamond prices using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features such as carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z). The models used for prediction are Decision Tree, Linear Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate the price of diamonds based on their characteristics. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide a tool that can assist in the valuation of diamonds.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `carat`: The weight of the diamond.
- `cut`: The quality of the cut (e.g., Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal).
- `color`: The color of the diamond (e.g., D, E, F, G, H, I, J).
- `clarity`: The clarity of the diamond (e.g., I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF).
- `depth`: The depth percentage of the diamond.
- `table`: The table percentage of the diamond.
- `price`: The price of the diamond.
- `x`: The length of the diamond in mm.
- `y`: The width of the diamond in mm.
- `z`: The depth of the diamond in mm.
